Helper: Sudoku helper application that can be run by a user from the command line that will let him or her interactively solve a Sudoku puzzle. The program stores information for a sudoku board by storing information for the individual sudoku squares. Information stored for each square includes row and column position within the board, the possibility set of marks, the current mark, and whether or not the mark is immutable. Additional information is stored for the board itself: the number of rows, the number of columns, and the total number of squares. Clusters, a set of squares that must be filled in with distinct marks, has been introduced. This program handles three types of classical Sudoku clusters: rows, columns and squares. Each time a mark is recorded for a square, the mark is removed from the possibility sets of the the other squares in each of the clusters it is contained in. The board now prints the Board nicely using Unicode characters (U+2500 code chart). Users are able to use undo and redo functions, and add or erase individual marks.

BoardState: A copiable class used to store the current state of the board. This consists of copies of the Square objects in an array that comprise the board but not the clusters and other information that is in BSquare (and which doesnâ€™t change once the board has been constructed).
